        <h2>📜 About Me & Manifesto</h2>
        <p>Name: Oussama</p>
        <p>Surname: Ennar</p>
        <p>Age: 25</p>
        <p>Birthday: November 1996</p>
        <p>
          I know how to clearly put across my ideas and communicate with others
          enthusiastically and can listen to others. I am also able to carry out
          all aspects of the role and can work with unpredictable circumstances.
          I can remain calm in difficult situations, work well under pressure,
          and support and cooperate with others at the same time. I am very
          capable of dealing with customers on a regular basis to fulfil their
          requirements and can also build and maintain relationships with them
          as well as with work mates.
